# France Cyber Security Challenge (FCSC) 2025

Like every year, ANSSI organizes a competition to select the French team for the [European Cybersecurity Challenge ECSC](https://ecsc.eu/).

I am too old and I definitely do not have the level to join the French team, but I regularly participate in this competition because it allows me to develop all my skills.

Every year, I try to improve my ranking.

In these directories, you'll find the tools I use for the Forensics Challenge, as well as some articles.
