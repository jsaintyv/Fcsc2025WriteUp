# France Cyber Security Challenge 2025

As every year, ANSSI organizes a competition for the selection of the French team for the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC)

I usually participate in this competition because it's the one that allows me to work on all my skills.
Every year, I try to improve my ranking.
